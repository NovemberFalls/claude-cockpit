"""Studio owns the Cloudflare connector.

The operator used to run ``cloudflared`` themselves — a bare console window, or
an S4U scheduled task that needs elevation. Closing that window silently killed
remote access (R-178), and the task route asks a desktop user to reason about
logon types (NOTE-196). Studio therefore supervises the connector itself: one
hidden child process, restarted with backoff when it dies, with a Start/Stop
button in Settings ▸ Remote.

THE TOKEN IS A SECRET AND NEVER ENTERS settings.json. settings.json is
deliberately exportable/shareable, so the token lives beside the provider API
keys in ``config.json`` (``cloudflare_tunnel_token``), reusing
``settings_store``'s atomic config read/write. It is never returned by any
route: status reports ``token_set: bool`` and nothing more. It is passed to the
child as an argv element, never logged, and every line captured from the child
is scrubbed of the token string before it reaches the ring buffer or the log
file — cloudflared itself has been known to echo its arguments on a usage
error, and a log file is exactly where a secret must not be.

A ``cloudflared`` that Studio did NOT start is not ours: ``foreign_running``
says so, so the UI can explain "another connector is already running outside
Studio" rather than fighting it or pretending the state is ours.

ORPHANS, AND WHY IDENTITY IS PROVEN BEFORE ANYTHING IS TERMINATED (2026-09-09).
``TunnelManager.stop()`` runs on the graceful shutdown path only, and on this
app that path is the exception, not the rule (see ``temp_sweep``'s docstring and
NOTE-197): the owner's machine held five orphaned Studio connectors, one per
unclean server exit. Startup is the only moment reached however the last process
died, so ``sweep_orphan()`` runs there.

**R-185 is the rule that decides the design: ``cloudflared.exe`` is NOT a Studio
process.** Several Plexar products run that same binary -- Plexar-LLM's tunnel
is ``cloudflared tunnel run plexar-vllm`` under its own supervisor -- and
terminating by process NAME took that product's service down. So Studio
terminates only a connector it can PROVE it started, exactly the way
``instance_guard`` gates its kill on ``SIDECAR_NAMES`` and ``temp_sweep`` gates
its removal on a marker:

  * spawning writes an OWNERSHIP RECORD (``connector-owner.json``, beside the
    connector log) naming the connector pid, the Studio pid that spawned it, and
    a SHA-256 of the exact argv;
  * the sweep terminates that pid only when the record's Studio owner is gone,
    the live process is a ``cloudflared``, AND the hash of its live command line
    equals the recorded one. **A pid that now runs a different command line is
    left alone** -- that is a recycled pid or another product's connector.
  * the token never enters the record: a hash cannot be read back, and the argv
    carries the secret.

Adoption of a healthy orphan was considered and rejected: supervision here means
owning the child's stdout pipe and its exit code, and neither can be reattached
to a process we did not spawn. Terminate-and-respawn is the honest option.
